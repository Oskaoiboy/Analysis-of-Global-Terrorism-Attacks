# Analysis-of-Global-Terrorism-Attacks
Terrorism is the threat or actual use of unlawful force and violence by a non-state actor to achieve a political, economic, religious or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation. Terrorism indeed overshadows all aspects of economic, social, cultural and political life. While this leads to instability and disrupts the peace and environment of coexistence, it directly endangers people's lives and brings all forms of violence into society.

In this project I analyze terrorist attacks around the world. I will focus on the factors that influence the death of people, the use of weapons and go through the regions where there have been many different attacks, and try to create models.
 
The dataset is taken from the webpage of kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtdselect=globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv.
The following data was used for analysis: 'Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Country', 'Region', 'city', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'AttackType', 'Killed', 'Wounded ',' Target ',' Summary ',' Group ',' Target_type ',' Weapon_type ',' Motive '.
The main goal of the project is to extract some thoughts from the dataset by examining and conducting research.

Analysis includes the following research questions:
1. The most commonly used weapon for a terrorist attack.
2. Terrorist groups with the most frequent attacks.
3. Who suffers more from terrorist attacks?
4. Which regions are most affected by terrorist attacks?
5. Terrorist attacks in Kazakhstan every year.
